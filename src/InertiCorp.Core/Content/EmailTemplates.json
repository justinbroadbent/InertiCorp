      "CEO,\n\nPer your directive to \"shake things up,\" I've restructured our project portfolio. {cardsDiscarded} initiatives have been... reprioritized (read: quietly killed), and {cardsDrawn} exciting new opportunities have emerged from the backlog.\n\nThe team is calling it \"strategic pivoting.\" Marketing wants to put it on a t-shirt.\n\nSeveral project managers have updated their LinkedIn profiles to \"open to opportunities.\" Coincidence, I'm sure.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - The bean bag chairs from the cancelled wellness initiative are still in my office. Do you want them?",
      "CEO,\n\nThe great project purge of Q{quarterNumber} is complete. {cardsDiscarded} initiatives have been sunset (corporate speak for \"mercy killing\"), and we've drawn {cardsDrawn} fresh projects from the idea backlog.\n\nMorale is... mixed. Some teams are relieved. Others are quietly sobbing in the break room. The coffee machine has never been busier.\n\nOn the bright side, we've freed up approximately 47 Jira boards. IT is thrilled.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - Should I cancel the launch party for the cancelled initiatives, or just call it a \"learning celebration\"?",
      "CEO,\n\nYour command to pivot has been executed with surgical precision. We've archived {cardsDiscarded} projects to the \"strategic parking lot\" (where ideas go to die) and excavated {cardsDrawn} promising initiatives from the depths of the backlog.\n\nThe affected teams have been notified via a carefully worded email that used the phrase \"exciting new direction\" no fewer than seven times.\n\nFun fact: three separate people have asked me if this means we're being acquired. I said no. Are we being acquired?\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director",
      "CEO,\n\nThe portfolio restructuring is complete. {cardsDiscarded} projects have been \"deprioritized indefinitely\" (killed), and {cardsDrawn} new initiatives have been fast-tracked to your attention.\n\nI've scheduled a \"celebration of learnings\" for the sunset projects. Cake will be served. It's the least we can do.\n\nThe good news: our Gantt charts are much cleaner now.\nThe bad news: several product managers are questioning their career choices.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - The project naming committee would like to know if they're still funded.",
      "CEO,\n\nOperation Clean Slate is complete. {cardsDiscarded} projects have been ceremonially thrown into the corporate volcano, and {cardsDrawn} new initiatives have risen from the ashes like caffeinated phoenixes.\n\nThe reorg went smoothly, if you don't count:\n- Three resignations (two were bluffs)\n- One impromptu all-hands meeting\n- The brief occupation of Conference Room B by displaced PMs\n\nProductivity should return to normal by Thursday. Maybe Friday.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - Someone left a passive-aggressive sticky note on my monitor. I'm choosing to interpret it as gratitude.",
      "CEO,\n\nThe strategic reshuffling you requested is done. We've traded in {cardsDiscarded} legacy projects for {cardsDrawn} shiny new ones.\n\nI've prepared talking points for the affected teams:\n- \"Change is opportunity\"\n- \"We're not canceling, we're refocusing\"\n- \"Your skills are highly transferable\"\n\nNo one believes any of them, but at least we're consistent.\n\nThe good news: our velocity metrics will reset to zero, so next quarter will look amazing by comparison.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - The motivational poster budget has been exhausted. We're down to \"Hang in There\" cat reproductions.",
      "CEO,\n\nPer your \"fresh perspectives\" mandate, I've conducted a comprehensive portfolio review. {cardsDiscarded} projects have been transitioned to \"archived visionary\" status, while {cardsDrawn} new initiatives have been activated.\n\nTeam reactions range from \"finally!\" to \"wait, I was working on that\" to complete silence (unclear if acceptance or shock).\n\nI've preemptively stocked the break room with stress snacks. It seemed prudent.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - Someone carved \"RIP Project Synergy\" into the bathroom stall. Should I report it or frame it?",
      "CEO,\n\nYour reorg directive has been implemented. The body count: {cardsDiscarded} discontinued, {cardsDrawn} born.\n\nI'd like to note that we've now reorged twice this year, which I believe qualifies us for some sort of corporate agility award. Or therapy. Possibly both.\n\nThe teams are adapting. By which I mean they're already betting on which of the new projects will survive until Q4. The over/under is 2.5.\n\n- Alex Rivera, Engineering Director\n\nP.S. - Should I update the \"Days Since Last Reorg\" sign to zero, or just take it down permanently?"

The board is \"cautiously optimistic.\"\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - The photographer got your good side. All seven photos are usable.",
      "CEO,\n\nThe image rehabilitation initiative has been executed. Your corporate karma has improved by 1 point (from {oldEvil} to {newEvil}).\n\nActions taken:\n- Sponsored a local little league team (the \"InertiCorp Junior Synergizers\")\n- Released a heartfelt statement about \"values-driven leadership\" (Legal approved every word)\n- Smiled in a photo with employees (the intern coaching was worth it)\n\nThe PR team is calling it a \"strategic authenticity campaign.\" I'm calling it a good start.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - We've retired the phrase \"move fast and break things\" from your talking points. You're welcome.",
      "CEO,\n\nYour reputation is on the mend.

You only said \"synergy\" twice in your last interview.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - Glassdoor reviews are up 0.3 stars. The interns are doing great work.",

Some might even call it... sincere.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - The company-wide \"values\" poster with your face on it ships next week. Try to look excited.",
      "CEO,\n\nYour redemption arc continues! The public perception needle has moved from \"who hurt them?\" to \"maybe they're trying.\"\n\nEvil Score improvement: {oldEvil} to {newEvil}\n\nThis quarter's virtue signaling--I mean, genuine initiatives:\n- Volunteered at a food bank (photo op duration: 23 minutes)\n- Adopted a highway (the boring stretch, but still)\n- Gave a TED talk about \"empathetic leadership\" (standing ovation was mandatory)\n\nCynics remain skeptical, but the algorithm loves you now.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - We've scheduled your next authenticity moment for Tuesday. Dress casually but not TOO casually.",
      "CEO,\n\nGood news on the optics front! Your personal brand has improved from \"Lex Luthor\" to \"Tony Stark, maybe?\" \n\nCorporate karma update: {oldEvil} to {newEvil}\n\nReputation-building activities completed:\n- Mentored a startup founder (they took notes!)\n- Appeared on a podcast about \"leadership with heart\" (only went off-script twice)\n- Donated your quarterly bonus to charity (tax-deductible, of course)\n\nThe narrative is shifting. We've successfully planted seeds of doubt about your previous villainy.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - The documentary crew has been politely declined. For now.",
      "CEO,\n\nThe charm offensive is working. Your Q{quarterNumber} reputation metrics show genuine improvement.\n\nEvil Score: {oldEvil} to {newEvil}\n\nKey wins:\n- Industry award for \"Executive Transformation\" (we may have nominated ourselves)\n- Positive coverage in three trade publications (one was earned, two were... encouraged)\n- Zero new memes this month (a record!)\n\nYour enemies remain unconvinced, but the fence-sitters are coming around.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - Legal has cleared you to use the word \"humble\" in interviews again. Use sparingly.",
      "CEO,\n\nThe rehabilitation continues. Your reputation has improved one whole point (from {oldEvil} to {newEvil}), which in PR terms is practically a comeback story.\n\nWhat we did:\n- Released a behind-the-scenes video of you being \"relatable\" (the bloopers humanize you)\n- Coordinated a surprise birthday celebration for a random employee (they seemed... surprised)\n- Updated your Wikipedia page (minor edits, all verifiable)\n\nPublic sentiment is cautiously warming. A few people even defended you on Twitter unprompted.\n\n- Riley Thompson, Marketing VP\n\nP.S. - We've retired the \"corporate overlord\" joke from your speaking notes. Finally."

      "CEO,\n\nThe private wine tasting event exceeded expectations. Sterling actually laughed at your joke about quarterly projections. LAUGHED.

      "CEO,\n\nYour keynote at the charity gala was perfect. Humble enough to seem genuine, confident enough to project competence. The speechwriter earned their bonus.\n\nSterling cornered me afterward to say you're \"finally showing some polish.\" From her, that's practically a marriage proposal.\n\nFavorability boost: +{change}% (current: {newFav}%)\n\nKeep this up and you might survive the next proxy vote.\n\n- Jordan Blake, CFO",
      "CEO,\n\nThe yacht trip was an unqualified success. Nothing builds board rapport like being trapped on open water together for 6 hours.\n\nHighlights:\n- You correctly identified a type of fish (impressive)\n- Patricia didn't once mention your predecessor (miracle)\n- No one fell overboard (low bar, but cleared)\n\nFavorability: +{change}% (now {newFav}%)\n\nRecommendation: More nautical bonding.\n\n- Jordan Blake, CFO"

It starts Tuesday.\n\n- Jordan Blake, CFO",
